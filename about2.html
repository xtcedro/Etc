        <h2>My Journey and Mission</h2>
        <p>
            My Catholic faith is the foundation of who I am. It has instilled in me the values of
            <strong>integrity</strong>, <strong>compassion</strong>, and <strong>service</strong>.
            These principles drive my passion for helping individuals and businesses thrive through
            reliable technology solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have years of hands-on experience fixing tech problems and helping people get the most out of their devices. I'm skilled with Linux systems, can set up and manage servers on AWS, and offer advice on purchasing domains to get your business online. I also create professional, user-friendly websites that fit your needs, making the process simple and efficient.

            Lately, I’ve been diving into software development, picking up new skills quickly to better serve my clients. Whether it’s tech repairs, websites, or server setups, I’m here to provide fast, affordable, and reliable solutions for the people and businesses of Oklahoma. I am committed to delivering <strong>transparent</strong>, <strong>fair</strong>, and <strong>secure</strong> digital services
            that empower our community.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "I envision a future where technology serves everyone, bridging gaps and creating opportunities for all.
            Guided by faith, I strive to build a world of trust, accountability, and innovation."
